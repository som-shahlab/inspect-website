EHRSHOT releases the weights and code of a 141M-parameter foundation model pretrained on 2.57 million deidentified EHRs from Stanford Hospital.

The foundation model is based on [the CLMBR architecture (Steinberg et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420302653), which uses a next token prediction task to learn representations for patients.

### Access

These assets will be publicly shared in coming months, under a standard research Data Usage Agreement. We will update this page once the model is available.

### Additional Details

For more information, please read [the original EHRSHOT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02028).

### Questions?

For questions and feedback, please open an [Issue on Github](https://github.com/som-shahlab/ehrshot-benchmark/)
