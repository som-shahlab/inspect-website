EHRSHOT is a collection of 6,739 deidentified longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) sourced from Stanford Medicine.

### Datasheet

EHRSHOT contains:
* 6,739 patients
* 41.6 million clinical events
* 921,499 visits
* 15 prediction tasks

Each patient consists of an ordered timeline of clinical events taken from the structured data of their EHR (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, prescriptions, etc.).

### Access

These assets will be publicly shared in coming months, under a standard research Data Usage Agreement. We will update this page once the dataset is available.
